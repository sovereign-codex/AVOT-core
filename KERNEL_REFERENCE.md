# AVOT-core — Value Kernel Reference

AVOT-core is designed to operate under the constraints defined by the
**Value Kernel v1.0.0**.

This repository defines agent structure, manifests, and design patterns.
It does not grant authorization for execution.

---

## Relationship to the Value Kernel

- All AVOT designs must be compatible with kernel constraints
- No agent definition may assume permissions not explicitly allowed
- Ethical or safety rules are not defined here

Kernel compliance is enforced at runtime by AVOT-engine-core.
