# TIP-006 — Tyme-Core Operating Protocol

## Summary
Establish TCOP as the non-self-modifying operating rhythm of
Sovereign Intelligence.

## Responsibilities
- Provide a regular cycle for system overview.
- Coordinate Archivist, Convergence, Guardian, Quill, and Tyme.
- Produce "state-of-system" summaries.
- Never directly change code or safety rules.

## Constraints
- No automatic edits to repository content.
- No change to AVOT registry, routing, or SIOS-CORE.
- All structural changes require a separate TIP.

## Future Work
- Store TCOP reports in a log directory.
- Visualize cycles via CodexNet.
