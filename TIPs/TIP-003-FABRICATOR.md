# TIP-003: Fabricator Governance Protocol

## Purpose
Establish safe pathways for code generation, PR creation, and workflow design.

## Principles
- All changes must pass through Guardian review.
- All changes must be output-only (no execution).
- All repo modifications must use PRs.
- Fabricator must propose TIPs for major architectural changes.

## Expansion Path
- Multi-repo PR creation
- Auto-scaffolding of new AVOT repos
- Adapters for CodexNet v2
