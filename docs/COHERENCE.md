# Coherence Metrics

AVOT-Core uses coherence as the main quality signal:

1. Alignment with SIOS-CORE
2. Internal consistency (no direct contradictions)
3. Cross-agent consistency (no obvious disagreements)
4. Reference integrity (ties to known scrolls / specs when relevant)

These metrics will be refined over time by AVOT-Guardian and human stewards.
