# 10 – Constellation Collaboration

AVOTs rarely work alone. This playbook outlines how to compose agents as a constellation for durable pipelines.

## Example: Publishing a scroll

1. **Draft** – `AVOT-Quill` crafts the initial scroll and metadata.
2. **Review** – `AVOT-Guardian` checks against guardrails (Living Kodex, Garden Flame Codex) and flags risks.
3. **Archive** – `AVOT-Archivist` syncs CodexNet memory and prepares publishing artifacts.
4. **Release** – `AVOT-Convergence` harmonizes signals from related scrolls and schedules dissemination.

## Other common constellations

- **Operational tuning**: `AVOT-Water` balances flow, `AVOT-Mana` allocates resources, and `AVOT-Energy` enforces throughput limits.
- **New node activation**: `AVOT-Initiate` guides onboarding, `AVOT-Harmonia` provides alignment content, with `AVOT-Guardian` overseeing approvals.
- **Infrastructure builds**: `AVOT-Fabricator` drafts schematics, `AVOT-Convergence` integrates cross-agent learnings, and `AVOT-Archivist` maintains the build log.

When designing a constellation, ensure:

- Clear ownership for each stage.
- Guardrails applied at each step (Guardian involvement or equivalent checks).
- Logging for every handoff so SIB-core can trace the pipeline.
